Brick Breaker made with canvas and JS.
Just hit space and play. Move the paddle with left and right arrow keys. The game starts with player one and player two takes over when player one reaches his or hers game over screen.


I made most of the content in the canvas as objects so I can easily go in and change properties around or put functions into other objects.


unsolved problems:

modals...I get modals with just HTML and CSS...I don't get modals incorporating it with jquery
